# My Weather App

## Purpose
For this challenge, I wanted to create a weather application that would allow users to access the current and future weather of a city when that city name is entered into a search bar. When entered, the city's current weather and its five-day forecast is displayed on the page. Also, a history button for that city is created which allows the user to access the weather of cities previously searched. 

## Built With
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Moment.js
*Bootstrap
